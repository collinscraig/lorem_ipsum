## Installing Hugo

Hugo is  a single binary without dependencies or any database, unlike other static site generators built on expensive runtimes like Ruby, Python or PHP. You just need to download the latest version. For more information read the official installation guides.


Once installed, ensure Hugo is set up as expected by running the `version` command. You should see a similar version number in your terminal:

```
$ hugo version
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.26 darwin/amd64 BuildDate: 2017-08-11T15:26:00-03:00
```
